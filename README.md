## HOW TO RUN PARTISAN

## I. Installation

PARTISAN runs with the standard version of MATLAB, and requires the MATLAB Image Processing toolbox. To install PARTISAN, simply extract the file partisan.zip provided in Supplement S1 into a folder of your choice.



## II. Instruction to run PARTISAN

1. 
Assign a working folder for the program. This can be done in the MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) by right-clicking on the respective directory in the "Current folder" pane and selecting "Add path > Selected folders" or using the "addpath()" command. 

2. 
Specify the type of images to be analyzed. This is done by adjusting line 58 in the code of partisan.m. 

img_files = dir('*.tif');      %%%%%%%%%%%  <-- adjust as needed  %%%%%%%%%%%%

For example, if it is planned to batch analyze a series of PNG images, the operator simply has to assign '*.png', meaning the line would read:

img_files = dir('*.png');      %%%%%%%%%%%  <-- adjust as needed  %%%%%%%%%%%%


3. 
To enable or disable the generation of figure windows, set the  "do_plots" directive to line 53 in Partisan.m either "true" or "false".


For example, if you want to activate this functionality, line 53 reads:

do_plots = true;


Note that as a result, for each image analyzed, a figure window is opened. It is recommended to deactivate this functionality in case you do run a batch process over a large number of images.
In this case change line 53 as follows:

do_plots = false;
 

4. 
PARTISAN may be started by simply typing "Partisan" on the MATLAB command line. (Or by clicking on the "Run" button in the MATLAB GUI).


## III OUTPUT
As output file "particle_shapes.csv" is generated.
Furthermore figure windows are opened for each analyzed image, if the "do_plots" directive is set to "true".




## IV. Additional options (for advanced MATLAB users):

To allow for batch processing we have deliberately avoided file selection dialogs which would require interactive user input. To aid in batch processing, the Partisan.m program itself may be embedded within another MATLAB wrapper script  that would automatically recurse into subfolders as needed.
A user with multiple directories of images to be processed can take advantage of a multi-core processor by launching multiple instances of MATLAB, changing into the respective image directories, and launching Partisan.m in each of them.
